# Hollywood-Gender-Representation

I conducted text analysis of plot descriptions of movies to compare the use of words between films that
have good and bad female representation. I used the Bechdel test as a measure of female representation,
which looks at whether a movie has at least two named female characters who talk to each other about
something other than a man. By analyzing the plot descriptions, I aimed to understand how movies with
good and bad female representation differ in the words they use. Even though the Bechdel test isnâ€™t the sole
indicator of female representation in films, this analysis can provide insights into how women are portrayed
in movies and how their representation can impact the way we perceive and value women in society.
