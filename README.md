# Hollywood-Gender-Representation

I conducted text analysis of plot descriptions of movies to compare the use of words between films that
have good and bad female representation. I used the Bechdel test as a measure of female representation,
which looks at whether a movie has at least two named female characters who talk to each other about
something other than a man. By analyzing the plot descriptions, I aimed to understand how movies with
good and bad female representation differ in the words they use. Even though the Bechdel test isnâ€™t the sole
indicator of female representation in films, this analysis can provide insights into how women are portrayed
in movies and how their representation can impact the way we perceive and value women in society.

The datasets were obtained from a study conducted by FiveThirtyEight on Hollywood's gender bias. The datasets can be downloaded from the following Github repository https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-03-09  

We found that movies with better female representation (passed Bechdel Test) had more common words in the plot like "woman", "school", "life", "girl", "family", which implies themes of domesticity. In contrast, movies with less female representation (failed Bechdel Test) had plots with common words like "life", "world", "story", and "team", which implies more adventure-driven plots. These findings suggest that there are differences in the types of movies that pass or fail the Bechdel Test, which may be related to the representation of female characters in the movies. The themes that we observed in the movies that passed or failed the Bechdel Test reflect certain gender norms that have been perpetuated in media. The use of words like "woman", "school", "life", "girl", and "family" in the plots of movies that passed the Bechdel Test suggests that these movies may be more oriented towards domestic themes that are traditionally associated with women. On the other hand, movies that failed the Bechdel Test tended to have more adventure-driven plots with words like "life", "world", "story", and "team", which aligns with traditional masculine gender norms.

This type of analysis is important because it helps to shed light on potential differences in how women are represented in media, and how this representation might differ based on whether a movie passes or fails the Bechdel Test. By understanding these differences, we can start to identify potential biases and patterns that may exist in media and work towards creating more equitable representation of women in movies. Additionally, this analysis can contribute to a broader conversation around gender and media representation, and help us to better understand the ways in which media shapes our perceptions and expectations of gender roles.
